 **BotChehara - The Bot Who Could Not Forget**  

BotChehara is a Slack Bot that recognizes pictures of celebrities, famous landmarks and extracts texts from pictures of documents. *Chehara* is Hindi for Face. BotChehara was inspired by the SMSBot *faces* (see: http://github.com/skarlekar/faces). 

BotChehara is 100% Serverless AIaaS[^aiaas] micro-service built on top of the [Serverless Framework](http://www.serverless.com)  and uses Python, [SlackAPI](https://api.slack.com/), [AWS StepFunctions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions), [AWS Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition) and [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision). You can invite BotChehara to your [Slack](https://slack.com/) Workspace. Whenever a picture is posted on the invited channel, BotChehara will analyze the picture to identify faces of celebrities, famous landmarks and post the biography or description & map of the landmark back to the channel. If a picture of a scanned document or signage is uploaded, the bot detects text and posts the extracted raw text back to the channel.


# Audience

You are a Developer or Solutions Architect wanting to learn how to build serverless applications that are auto-scaling, pay-per-execution and completely event-driven. You want to build applications that matters to business instead of spending time configuring, deploying and maintaining infrastructure. The boost in efficiency that the Serverless architecture promises is very compelling for you to ignore.

As you are building this application, you will to use the Serverless Framework, Slack Web & Event API,  Boto3 - Amazon's AWS Python SDK and Google Vision API.

# The Architecture

The BotChehara application uses AWS API Gateway, AWS Step Function and Lambdas for compute needs. The Lambdas in turn makes uses of image recognition APIs from AWS & Google Cloud for detecting celebrities, landmarks and text from the given image. The application also uses AWS Dynamo DB for storing data about teams that are inviting the bot to their channels. 

As a result,  the application components are provisioned on-demand and brought down after usage resulting in a low-cost, highly-scalable application.

The above picture illustrates the high-level architecture of the application. Details are as follows:

 1. When the user installs our slack bot in their workspace, Slack will send a temporary authorization code. This authorization code is short-lived and can only be used to get a permanent access token. The *Slack Installer* Lambda function will use this authorization code to get a permanent access-token for the team along with other pertinent information regarding the team and store it in a Dynamo DB table. If the operation is successful or results in an error,  the Lambda returns a 302 HTTP code to have Slack redirect the user to a success/failure page.
